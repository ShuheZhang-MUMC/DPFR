# DPFR
Double-pass fundus reflection model for retinal image enhancement

This is the MATLAB code for DPFR model. 

In the 'simulation' folder, a Lena image (512*512) is regarded as ground truth. The 'get_degrade_image.m' generates 
a degraded image to simulate the formation of fundus imaging under different illumination and scattering conditions.

main_dpfm.m is the main programme of the DPFR model, while the subfunctions are in 'func' folder.
