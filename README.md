# DPFR
Double-pass fundus reflection model for retinal image enhancement

This is the MATLAB code for DPFR model. 
'main_dpfr.m' is the main programme of the DPFR model, while the subfunctions are in 'func' folder.
Some clinical retinal images are provided in 'testing image' folder.

In the 'simulation' folder, a Lena image (512*512) is regarded as the ground truth. The 'get_degrade_image.m' generates 
a degraded image to simulate the formation of fundus imaging under different illumination and scattering conditions.
